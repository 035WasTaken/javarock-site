# JavaRock Site
This is the source code for the JavaRock website, by @035WasTaken, @DUDEbehindDUDE, and @WSCKR (now with more @tjreigh). If you wish to run the site locally you simply have to open your terminal of choice (make sure you have node and the typescript package!) and run `tsc` and `nodemon`. It should launch the site at http://localhost:port, where port is the port that console gives you. This site currently utilizes typescript, javascript, sass, and html.

## Everything is still a WORK IN PROGRESS! There is no guarantee anything will work properly nor is any of the code seen here in it's final state. As of right now, a lot of the code seen here IS subject to change. There is a lot of bad code here at the moment, and this will get better as we get closer to release. Until then, just know that nothing here is finished, and again, is subject to change.
