# JavaRock Site
This is the source code for the JavaRock website, by @035WasTaken, @DUDEbehindDUDE, and @WSCKR. If you wish to (for some reason) run the site locally you simply have to run \<filename> in \<dir> and it should launch the site at http://localhost::80. This site currently utilizes \<languages>.


## Everything is still a WORK IN PROGRESS! There is no guarantee anything will work properly nor is any of the code seen here in it's final state. As of right now, a lot of the code seen here IS subject to change and is NOT in it's final form. There is a lot of bad code here at the moment, and this will get better as we get closer to release. Until then, just know that nothing here is finished, and again, is subject to change.
