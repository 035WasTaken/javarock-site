      <h2 class="anchor" id="software">Server Software</h2>
      <p>JavaRock Season 4 is running on Fabric 1.18.1 with <a
          href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium">Lithium</a> and <a
          href="https://github.com/Tuinity/Starlight">Starlight</a> used to
        increase the performance of the server. (Lithium makes server calculations more efficient and Starlight improves
        the lighting engine, which is better than Phosphor.)</p>
      <p>To allow crossplay, we have <a href="https://geysermc.org/">GeyserMC</a> and <a
          href="https://geysermc.org/">Floodgate</a>, which translate the packets
        from the Java Edition so that the Bedrock client can understand them, and vice versa. Floodgate converts Bedrock
        XUIDs to Java UUIDs so that Bedrock players don't need a Java account to play.</p>
      <h3 class="anchor" id="software.plugins">Plugins</h2>
        <p>Other than Lithium/Starlight and Geyser/Floodgate, we have some plugins that allow for minor
          improvements/features that you normally don't see in the vanilla game. These are:

        <h3 class="anchor" id="software.datapacks">Datapacks</h3>
        <p>We are using some packs from Vanilla Tweaks; what they do are basically self explanatory:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AFK Display</li>
          <li>Durability Ping</li>
          <li>More Mob Heads</li>

        </ul>
        <h4 class="anchor" id="software.datapacks.custom">Custom Datapacks</h4>
        <p>We are using a custom datapack to have weekly events, such as tag or wither hunt. In addition to this
          includes a datapack adding Terraria music to the game!</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="anchor" id="bedrock">Bedrock Info</h2>
      <p class="anchor" id="bedrock.java-features">Since the Bedrock and Java Editions are fundamentally different, if
        you are playing
        on Bedrock Edition, some mechanics are different. These include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Combat:</strong> If you are an avid Bedrock player, combat works a bit different in the Java
          Edition. There is an attack cooldown (represented by a bar in the middle of the screen when you attack), and
          your weapon won't do as much damage if it's not full. Also, axes do more damage than swords, but have a longer
          attack cooldown.</li>
        <li><strong>Redstone:</strong> Some redstone devices and mechanics (eg. <a
            href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity">quasi-connectivity</a>) work slightly
          differently in Java than in Bedrock. If you are building a tutorial for some redstone device, Bedrock ones may
          not work. This also applies to things such as villager breeders/etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Raids:</strong> You can get up to Bad Omen V (by killing 5 banner pillagers), which will result in a
          harder, but more rewarding, raid.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Crawling in 1 block tall spaces is possible (via being pushed into a 1 block tall
          space), and you can sneak into 1.5 block tall gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Nether:</strong> The nether build limit is now y=256, meaning you can make your gold farms on the
          nether roof!</li>
        <li><strong>Offhand:</strong> Although you cannot use the item unless it's possible to do so in Bedrock, you do
          have the ability to put any item in your offhand now through emoting or running '/geyser offhand'.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="anchor" id="bedrock.bugs">Bugs</h3>
      <p>There are a few things that may be buggy for Bedrock players due to the differences in the two games, notably:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mobile Buckets:</strong> Java Edition's packet for placing and picking up fluids only includes that
          the player is doing this, so they only place in the middle of the screen, regardless where you tap. (To remedy
          this, you can go into Settings&nbsp;>&nbsp;Touch and enable Split Controls.)</li>
        <li><strong>Crafting items in bulk:</strong> Crafting a ton of an item may be a bit slow due to the way Geyser
          translates crafting packets.</li>
        <li><strong>Bamboo:</strong> Bamboo (and also sometimes dripstone) is extremely buggy when you walk through it.
          This is because Bedrock renders the bamboo in a different spot than it is on Java, making the server thing you
          are in the block and lagging you back.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage:</strong> The bedrock attack damage descriptions for weapons are incorrect, since 1.9 combat
          did not really come to Bedrock.</li>
        <li><strong>Slabs:</strong> Rarely there may be some slab or stair that lags you back when you try to walk up
          it, this is because Bedrock and Java treat the hitbox of stairs differently.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="anchor" id="bedrock.settings">Settings</h3>
      <p>There are two settings that you can change for yourself specific to the server; enabling/disabling showing
        coordinates and setting the attack cooldown indicator to under your crosshair or above your hotbar. These are
        specific to you and can be accessed through Settings > Server.</p>
      <h3 class="anchor" id="bedrock.linking">Linking</h3>
      <p>You can link your Java and Bedrock accounts (so that when you join on Bedrock you will be automatically logged
        into your Java account) by entering the linking server (<a>link.geysermc.org</a>) and running /linkaccount.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="anchor" id="console">Consoles</h2>
      <p>Console users will be aware that you cannot join custom servers. Or so you thought! There are (simple)
        ways around this limitation:
      </p>
      <h3 class="method">Method 1:</h3>
      <p class="requirements">Requires: a phone/tablet (connected to the same network as your console), &lt;5 minutes
      </p>
      <p class="requirements">Works on: any console</p>
      <p>This method simply requires you to download an app (<a
          href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bedrocktogether/id1534593376">Bedrock Together</a> (iOS) and <a
          href="">MineProxy - Droid</a> (Android). In the app, you just have to enter the IP of the server you
        want to join, the port (default is 19132), and tap run or start. The server will then show up as a LAN game.</p>
      <h3 class="method">Method 2:</h3>
      <p class="requirements">Requires: the server tab, 4-8 minutes</p>
      <p class="requirements">Works on: XBOX and Nintendo Switch</p>
      <p>This method is slightly more complicated, as it requires changing your DNS. Videos on how to do this can be
        found below, but what's important is that you need to change your primary DNS to <em>104.238.130.180</em>, and
        change the secondary DNS to any popular DNS server (I prefer Cloudflare's DNS server (<em>1.1.1.1</em>),
        although in the
        videos he uses Google's DNS (<em>8.8.8.8</em>).)</p>
      <p>To undo this, you can change your DNS back to automatic.</p>
