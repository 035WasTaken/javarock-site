        An SMP that has crossplay with the Bedrock and Java Editions of

      <h2 class="anchor" id="about">About JavaRock</h2>
      <p>
        JavaRock was started because I believe that Java Edition is superior,
        yet many of my friends only can play on Bedrock. I found a plugin called
        GeyserMC, and it allows for crossplay between the two editions (with the
        server still running on Java).
      </p>
      <p>Season 4 is starting soon on Java 1.18, and we will be using the following plugins (as/if/when they are
        released):</p>
      <ul>

        <li>SpawnRadius: 3</li>
        <li>(All other gamerules are at their default values)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and some datapacks from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net">Vanilla Tweaks</a>:
      <ul>
        <li>AFK Display</li>
        <li>Durability Ping</li>
        <li>More Mob Heads</li>
        <li>Player Head Drops</li>

        <li>Track Statistics</li>
        <li>Wandering Trades</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to this, we also have a custom datapack that selects a random event every week. This can be
        something like tag (you should know what this is) or wither hunt (kill as many winners as possible). In games
        with winners, they will be awarded, but in a game with losers, they will get punished.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Sadly, crossplay between 2 fundamentally different versions of the game is not (yet) perfected (and thus playing
        on the Java Edition is a better experience). It does still work well, but these are the most prevalent issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On mobile, buckets only place in the middle of the screen as the Java
          Edition packet doesn't specify where the bucket is placed
        </li>
        <li>
          Bedrock players may occasionally experience rubberbanding when going
          over slabs, stairs, etc. as Bedrock treats their hitboxes differently
        </li>
        <li>
          Bedrock players can't easily put things other than shields, totems,
          and arrows into their offhand as this is a client-side limitation.
          You can emote to swap your main hand and offhand, but you can't use
          your offhand items unless you can on Bedrock.
        </li>
        <li>
          The glowing effect doesn't work and the spectral arrow texture is just
          a normal arrow as they don't exist in Bedrock
        </li>
      </ul>
